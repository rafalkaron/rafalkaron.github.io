## Content developer

Throughout my IT career, I have worn a number of different hats. Nevertheless, my main role has always involved content creation, manipulation, organization, or automation.

My profession goes by different names, including: technical writer, technical documentation specialist, information developer, or content developer. Since I have had an opportunity to develop and manipulate a wide variety of assets, I find the most general *content developer* term the most apt to describe my occupation.

### Key tools and technologies

Professionally, I have mainly worked with **oXygen XML Editor** integrated with web-based **Composite Content Management Systems (CCMSs)** that support **DITA XML**. I am also familiar with the **RST** format and I have had an opportunity to work with **Author-it**.

For personal purposes, I use **Visual Studio Code**, **GitHub**, and **Markdown**. I generate content with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and publish it with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Formerly, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static sites.

## Coder

I am a self-taught coder and a fan of [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Currently, I develop my side projects on my own and collaborate with software developers at work. My IDE of choice is **Visual Studio Code**. I can quit **Vim** if needed.  

I won't lie, I prompt Bing for inspiration from time to time. I've found it extremely helpful for composing shell scripts that run in my homelab.

### Technologies

I am keen on finding ways to automate, optimize, and generate reports to save my coworkers from opening terminals or doing repetitive work.

Python
: I am a self-taught Python coder. I use Python in my side projects and to develop internal tools at work. To make coding easier, I've implemented **mypy**, **Ruff**, and **Black** into my workflow.
{.text_small}

MicroPython
: I run MicroPython on **Raspberry Pi[^1] Pico** boards. The code interacts with databases and APIs, reads sensor data, and manipulates output devices.
{.text_small}

InfluxDB
: I use InfluxDB to gather data from sensors and APIs in my homelab.

Bash
: I use Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks on my macOS and Linux machines.
{.text_small}

Apart from the backend activities, I also enjoy styling and templating websites and other outputs.

HTML
: I am proficient in using semantic HTML5 and I advocate structured content.
{.text_small}

CSS
: I am skilled in developing CSS for different viewports, including: responsive websites, web apps, and printed media.  
I am also familiar with **LESS** and **SCSS**.
{.text_small}

JavaScript
: I use JavaScript to implement basic functionalities to websites and create simple web apps.
{.text_small}

XML
: I am a **DITA XML** expert familiar with both **technical content** and **learning and training** specializations. I use **XPath** to run complex queries.
{.text_small}

### Content generators

 As a content developer who uses DITA professionally, I aim at separating content from styling and making it as semantic as possible.

DITA Open Toolkit
: My limited **XSL** knowledge enables me to develop simple [DITA-OT](https://www.dita-ot.org/) customizations.

Prince XML
: I have a vast experience in styling PDF templates with HTML, CSS, a touch of XSLT, and the [Prince XML](https://www.princexml.com/) converter. To reduce the code maintenance time, I always make my templates modular, customizable, and extensible.
{.text_small}

Hugo
: I am experienced in designing, developing, and styling Hugo sites. I developed this site from scratch in Hugo. I leverage the **Liquid** template language to keep the template logic modular.
{.text_small}

Jekyll
: I have a considerable experience in designing, developing, and styling Jekyll sites. My legacy website used Jekyll under the hood.
{.text_small}

Gatsby
: I have some experience in customizing sites generated by using Gatsby with LESS, TypeScript, and Material Design in mind.
{.text_small}

Docusaurus
: I am experienced in styling Docusaurus sites, extending Docusaurus sites functionalities, and modifying their behavior.
{.text_small}

MkDocs
: I use MkDocs for some of my Python side projects.
{.text_small}

Sphinx
: I have some experience in customizing Sphinx output.
{.text_small}

### Platforms

On daily basis, I run **macOS**. Professionally, I have been using **Windows** machines.  
To stay in the Linux loop, I  run **Ubuntu** (formerly **Fedora**) on my vintage MacBook Air and **Debian** on my **Raspberry Pi[^1] 4B**.

## Agile leader

Does Scrum work in every content development team? Yes and no. Does every content development team need an Agile leader? Yes, it does.

### Methodology

Scrum was designed as a work framework with an emphasis on software development teams. While it is possible to treat [docs as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/), content development and software development are still significantly different processes. The difference between them is particularly prominent if content creators are not regular members of software development teams.

I consider the [Scrum Guide](https://www.Scrumguides.org/index.html) a great basis for building an Agile framework in any development team. However, I often take the liberty of proposing, test-driving, and implementing various alterations to the approach suggested in the guide. If the docs tend to be developed on an ad hoc basis, I am not afraid of gravitating towards the Kanban framework.

### Tools

As a person who always has a clean desk, I enjoy well-curated backlogs, clearly defined items, flawless filters, and model burndown charts.

My weapon of choice is **Jira**; however, I am open to any alternative WMS solutions. For some teams, I also find **Confluence** a good and well-integrated addition to Jira, which can serve as an internal knowledge base.

I am an ardent supporter of keeping everything related to work management in a single place. In the long run, an avalanche of shared sheets is not a maintainable approach.

## Tester

Documenting software often involves clicking through the GUI or using the CLI. Because of that, I often find:

* Curious bugs
* UX issues
* UI inconsistencies

As an Agile leader, I can log bugs, improvements, and feature suggestions like a tester. Additionally, my technical writing expertise enables me to clearly define steps to reproduce (STRs) and acceptance criteria (AC).

## Teacher

Once a teacher, always a teacher.

Having a master's degree and experience in teaching English helps me to:

* Clearly formulate procedural steps
* Onboard new employees and conduct workshops
* Efficiently communicate with my team and SMEs
* Confidently demonstrate how software or processes work
* Act as a consultant

## After hours

I am keen on cutting-edge technologies and learning about creative business models. I can appreciate art and design in many forms. I enjoy individual sports and books that broaden my worldview. I am a minimalist who requires a clean room to work or relax. I value privacy, so I am not overly active on social media.

### Technology

I believe that any content developer in the IT sector should be a tech geek. It is much easier to document things that you find interesting. I enjoy discussing and ranting about tech trends and modern business models with my fellow content developers.

### Photography

I realize that nowadays any decent smartphone is capable of capturing and processing stunning photos. At the same time, I still enjoy setting up my Canon DSLR and manually developing RAW photos in Lightroom or Affinity Photo.  

I shoot various kinds of photos ranging from portraits through macros to abstracts. If you are curious about my approach to photography, feel free to visit my [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@rafalkaron) profile.

### Hiking

I find mountain hiking refreshing. It also nicely integrates with my passion for photography. Luckily, there is an abundance of beautiful mountains to climb and photograph in my area.

### Cycling

I spent half of my childhood in a local bicycle shop and I love cycling. I can assemble and fix a bike. I cycle on my road bicycle most often but I also have an old-school mountain bike.

### Running

I usually run alone or with my friend. However, I broke my routine by taking part in [Business Run 2018](https://live.sts-timing.pl/businessrun2018/person.php?n=63&d=1) as one of the **Motorola Solutions Gatekeepers** runners.

### Origami

I find paper folding both intricate and relaxing. Also, paper figurines make fantastic gifts and minimalistic home or office decor.
