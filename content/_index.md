## Content developer

Throughout my IT career, I have embraced various roles, with the primary focus on content creation, manipulation, organization, migration, generation, and automation.

My profession is known by many titles, including technical writer, technical documentation specialist, information developer, or content developer. Given the diverse range of my responsibilities and expertise, I believe *content developer* best captures the essence of my work.

### Key tools and technologies

Professionally, I have mainly utilized **oXygen XML Editor** integrated with web-based **Composite Content Management Systems (CCMSs)** that support **DITA XML**. Additionally, I have extensive experience with the industry-standard **DITA XML**, **oXygen XML Editor**, and **GitHub Desktop** stack. I am also familiar with the **RST** format and have worked with **Author-it**. For internal documentation, I have mainly used **Confluence** and **Markdown** in various **README** files.

In my personal projects, I rely on **Visual Studio Code**, **GitHub**, and **Markdown**. I generate content with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and publish it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Formerly, I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static sites.

## Coder

I am a self-taught coder. Currently, I develop my side projects independently and collaborate with software developers at work. My IDE of choice is **Visual Studio Code**, though I can switch to **Vim** and quit it if needed.

I won't lie—I prompt AI for inspiration from time to time. I have found it extremely helpful for composing shell scripts that run in my homelab and for GitHub Actions.

### Technologies

I am keen on finding ways to automate, optimize, and generate reports to save my coworkers from opening terminals or doing repetitive work.

Python
: I am a self-taught Python coder. I use Python in my side projects and to develop internal tools at work. To make coding easier, I've implemented **mypy**, **Ruff**, and **Black** into my workflow. I also use Python for automations in GitHub Actions.

MicroPython
: I run MicroPython on **Raspberry Pi[^1] Pico** boards. The code interacts with databases and APIs, reads sensor data, and manipulates output devices.
{.text_small}

Databases
: I use **InfluxDB** to gather data from sensors and APIs in my homelab. For some side projects, I use **MongoDB**.

Bash
: I use Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks on my macOS and Linux machines. Shell scripts are also very handy for automations in GitHub Actions.
{.text_small}

Apart from the backend activities, I also enjoy styling and templating websites and other outputs.

HTML
: I am proficient in using semantic HTML5 and I advocate structured content.
{.text_small}

CSS
: I am skilled in developing CSS for different viewports, including: responsive websites, web apps, and printed media.  
I am also familiar with **LESS** and **SCSS**.
{.text_small}

JavaScript
: I use JavaScript to implement basic functionalities to websites and create simple web apps. Additionally, I have been developing **React** frontends with the assistance of **GitHub Copilot**.
{.text_small}

XML
: I am a **DITA XML** expert familiar with both **technical content** and **learning and training** specializations. I use **XPath** to run complex queries.
{.text_small}

### Content generators

 As a content developer who uses DITA professionally, I aim to separate content from styling and make it as semantic as possible.

DITA Open Toolkit
: My limited **XSL** knowledge enables me to develop simple [DITA-OT](https://www.dita-ot.org/) customizations.

Prince XML
: I have extensive experience in styling PDF templates with HTML, CSS, a touch of XSLT, and the [Prince XML](https://www.princexml.com/) converter. To reduce the code maintenance time, I always make my templates modular, customizable, and extensible.
{.text_small}

Hugo
: I am experienced in designing, developing, and styling Hugo sites. I developed this site from scratch in Hugo. I leverage the **Liquid** template language to keep the template logic modular.
{.text_small}

Jekyll
: I have considerable experience in designing, developing, and styling Jekyll sites. My legacy website used Jekyll under the hood.
{.text_small}

Gatsby
: I have some experience in customizing sites generated by using Gatsby with LESS, TypeScript, and Material Design in mind.
{.text_small}

Docusaurus
: I am experienced in styling Docusaurus sites, extending Docusaurus sites functionalities, and modifying their behavior.
{.text_small}

MkDocs
: I use MkDocs for some of my Python side projects.
{.text_small}

Sphinx
: I have some experience in customizing Sphinx output.
{.text_small}

### Platforms

On daily basis, I run **macOS**. Professionally, I have been using **Windows** machines.  
To stay in the Linux loop, I  run **Ubuntu** (formerly **Fedora**) on my vintage MacBook Air and **Debian** on my **Raspberry Pi[^1] 4B**.

## Agile leader

Does Scrum work in every content development team? Yes and no. Does every content development team need an Agile leader? Yes, it does.

### Methodology

Scrum was designed as a work framework with an emphasis on software development teams. While it is possible to treat [docs as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/), content development and software development are still significantly different processes. This difference is particularly prominent if content creators are not regular members of software development teams.

I consider the [Scrum Guide](https://www.Scrumguides.org/index.html) a great basis for building an Agile framework in any development team. However, I often take the liberty of proposing, test-driving, and implementing various alterations to the approach suggested in the guide. If the docs tend to be developed on an ad hoc basis, I am not afraid to gravitate towards the Kanban framework.

### Tools

As a person who always has a clean desk, I enjoy well-curated backlogs, clearly defined items, flawless filters, and model burndown charts.

My weapon of choice is **Jira**; however, I am open to any alternative WMS solutions. For some teams, I find **Confluence** a good and well-integrated addition to Jira, serving as an internal knowledge base.

I am an ardent supporter of keeping everything related to work management in a single place. In the long run, an avalanche of shared sheets is not a maintainable approach.

## Tester

Documenting software often involves clicking through the GUI or using the CLI. Because of that, I frequently discover:

* Curious bugs
* UX issues
* UI inconsistencies

As an Agile leader, I can log bugs, improvements, and feature suggestions like a tester. Additionally, my technical writing expertise enables me to clearly define steps to reproduce (STRs) and acceptance criteria (AC).

## Teacher

Once a teacher, always a teacher.

Having a master's degree in teaching English and experience in education, I excel at:

* Clearly formulating procedural steps
* Onboarding new employees and conducting workshops
* Efficiently communicating with my team and subject matter experts (SMEs)
* Confidently demonstrating software or processes
* Acting as a consultant

## After hours

I am passionate about cutting-edge technologies and intrigued by creative business models. I appreciate art and design in various forms. In my leisure time, I engage in individual sports and read books that broaden my worldview. As a minimalist, I thrive in a clean and organized environment for work and relaxation. Privacy is important to me, which is why I maintain a low profile on social media.

### Technology

I believe every content developer in the IT sector should be a tech geek. Documenting what interests you is far more engaging. I enjoy discussing and ranting about tech trends and modern business models.

### Photography

I realize that nowadays any decent smartphone is capable of capturing and processing stunning photos. At the same time, I still enjoy setting up my Canon DSLR and manually developing RAW photos in Lightroom or Affinity Photo.  

I shoot various kinds of photos ranging from portraits through macros to abstracts. If you are curious about my approach to photography, feel free to visit my [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@rafalkaron) profile.

### Running

I usually run on my own or with my friend. However, I broke my routine by taking part in [Business Run 2018](https://live.sts-timing.pl/businessrun2018/person.php?n=63&d=1) as one of the **Motorola Solutions Gatekeepers** runners.
