## Content developer

Throughout my IT career, I have worn a number of different hats. Nevertheless, my main role has always involved content creation, manipulation, organization, or automation.

My profession goes by different names, including: technical writer, technical documentation specialist, information developer, or content developer. Since I have had an opportunity to develop and manipulate a wide variety of assets, I find the most general *content developer* term the most apt to describe my occupation.

### Deliverables

As a content developer, I have been responsible for delivering different kinds of guides and product documentation, including:

{{% reuse "_reuse/product_docs.md" %}}

I believe that every content developer should be an information architect as well. I have been involved in development and maintenance of:

{{% reuse "_reuse/ia_docs.md" %}}

A well-written documentation should be understandable in plain text. However, developing and embedding media in deliverables makes them appealing to the end user. To make my documentation pleasant to look at, I have been involved in development of:

{{% reuse "_reuse/media.md" %}}

Did you know that content developers can cooperate with sales teams? During my startup adventure, I composed responses for the following document types sent by prospects:

{{% reuse "_reuse/sales.md" %}}

I have been also involved in creating sample content and templates for demo purposes.

### Output formats

My documentation has been published to a number of formats, including:

{{% reuse "_reuse/output_formats.md" %}}

I have been involved in user interface (UI) text reviews. The goal of UI text reviews is to make graphical user interfaces (GUIs) leaner and easier to navigate.

### Key tools and technologies

Professionally, I have mainly worked with **oXygen XML Editor** integrated with web-based **Composite Content Management Systems (CCMSs)** and **DITA XML** markup language. I am also somewhat familiar with the **RST** format and I have had an opportunity to work with **Author-it**.

For personal purposes, I use **Visual Studio Code**, **GitHub**, and **Markdown**. I generate content with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and publish it with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Formerly, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static sites.

## Agile leader

Does Scrum work in every content development team? Yes and no. Does every content development team need an Agile leader? Yes, it does.

### Methodology

Scrum was designed as a work framework with an emphasis on software development teams. While it is possible to treat [docs as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/), content and software development are still significantly different processes. The difference between them is particularly prominent if content creators are not regular members of software development teams.

I consider the [Scrum Guide](https://www.Scrumguides.org/index.html) a great basis for building an Agile framework in any development team. However, I often take the liberty of proposing, test-driving, and implementing various alterations to the approach suggested in the guide. If the docs tend to be developed on an ad hoc basis, I am not afraid of gravitating towards the Kanban framework.

### Tools

As a person who always has a clean desk, I enjoy well-curated backlogs, clearly defined items, flawless filters, and model burndown charts.

My weapon of choice is **Jira**; however, I am open to any alternative WMS solutions. For some teams, I also find **Confluence** a good and well-integrated addition to **Jira**, which can serve as an internal knowledge base.

I am an ardent supporter of keeping everything related to work management in a single place (WMS). In the long run, an avalanche of shared sheets is not a maintainable approach.

## Coder

I am a self-taught coder and a fan of [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Currently, I am being mentored to advance my Python skills and learn how to collaborate with other developers in my team.

### Backend technologies

I am keen on finding ways to automate, optimize, and generate reports to save other content developers from opening terminals or doing repetitive work.  

Python
: I am a self-taught Python coder who automates repetitive tasks, batch-converts content, and makes life easier for less tech-savvy users, who prefer to steer clear of the terminal window.  
I am a fan of the [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book and course.

Bash
: I use Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks on my macOS and Linux machines.

Regex
: When it comes to massive search and replace operations, Regex is my best friend.

XPath
: I use XPath to run complex XML and HTML queries that can be processed later on.

Ruby
: I know Ruby enough to set up Jekyll locally and generate static sites. I can also contribute to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/rafalkaron) and use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### Frontend technologies

Does every content developer dream of styling their content, or is it just me?

HTML 5
: I am proficient in using semantic HTML5 and an advocate of structured content.

CSS 3
: I am skilled in developing CSS for different viewports, including: responsive websites, web apps, and printed media.  
I am also familiar with **LESS** and **SCSS**.

Liquid
: I know how to leverage the liquid templating language to generate site structures that conform to my requirements.

XSL
: My limited XLS knowledge enables me to develop simple [DITA-OT](https://www.dita-ot.org/) customizations.

JavaScript
: I am currently learning JavaScript. I can manipulate the HTML DOM, implement basic functionalities to websites, and create simple web apps.

Node.js
: I mainly use Node.js to initialize local development environments for frameworks such as Gatsby or Docusaurus, build packages, and deploy builds.

### Content generators

I am familiar with templating for the following generators:

Prince XML
: I have a vast experience in styling PDF templates with HTML, CSS, a touch of XSLT, and the [Prince XML](https://www.princexml.com/) converter. To reduce the code maintenance time, I always make my templates modular, customizable, and extensible.

Hugo and Jekyll
: I have a considerable experience in designing, developing, and styling Hugo and Jekyll sites. As a content developer that uses DITA professionally, I aim at separating content from styling and making it as semantic as possible.

Gatsby
: I have some experience in customizing sites generated by using Gatsby with LESS, TypeScript, and Material Design in mind.

Docusaurus
: I am experienced in styling Docusaurus sites, extending Docusaurus sites functionalities, and modifying their behavior.

Sphinx
: I have some experience in customizing Sphinx output.

### Hardware and software platforms

On daily basis, I run **macOS**. Professionally, I use a **Windows** machine.  

As a hobby, I proudly run **Fedora Linux** on my old MacBook Air. When I got serious about its installation and configuration, I even received a *New Q/A User of the Month* badge on [Ask Fedora](https://ask.fedoraproject.org/u/techno-skryba/summary).

## Tester

Does anyone need to break an app or get fussy about the UX?

Documenting software often involves clicking through the GUI or using the CLI. Because of that, I often find:

* Curious bugs
* UX issues
* UI inconsistencies

As an Agile leader, I can log bugs, improvements, and feature suggestions like a tester. Additionally, my technical writing expertise enables me to clearly define steps to reproduce (STRs) and acceptance criteria (AC).

## Teacher

Once a teacher, always a teacher.

Having a master's degree and some experience in teaching English helps me to:

* Clearly formulate procedural steps
* Onboard new employees and conduct workshops
* Efficiently communicate with my team and SMEs
* Confidently demonstrate how software or processes work
* Act as a consultant

## After hours

I am keen on cutting-edge technologies and discovering creative business models. I can appreciate art and design in many forms. I enjoy individual sports and books that broaden my worldview. I am a minimalist who requires a clean room to work or relax. I value privacy, so I am not overly active on social media.

### Technology

I believe that any content developer in the IT sector should be a tech geek. It is much easier to document things that you find interesting.

I enjoy discussing and ranting about tech trends and modern business models with my fellow content developers. I stay up to date with the latest tech news mainly by subscribing to the [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee) and [Tech Linked](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeeFfhMcJa1kjtfZAGskOCA) YouTube channels. I also following the major IT industry players on Twitter and subscribe to tech-related Reddit boards.

I also enjoy reading blogs about Linux, FOSS, and security.
Here are some resources that I stay up-to-date with:

* [It's FOSS](https://itsfoss.com/)
* [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org/)
* [Niebezpiecznik](https://niebezpiecznik.pl/)
* [TechWriter.koduje()](https://techwriterkoduje.pl/)
{.text_small}

I also enjoy fixing or upgrading hardware with my [iFixit](https://ifixit.com) kit and Leatherman multitool. I believe that the [Right to repair](https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro) movement is a way to go.

### Photography

I realize that nowadays any decent smartphone is capable of capturing and processing stunning photos. At the same time, I still enjoy setting up my Canon DSLR and manually developing RAW photos in Lightroom.  

I shoot various kinds of photos ranging from portraits through macros to abstracts. If you are curious about my approach to photography, feel free to visit [Gallery](gallery).

### Hiking

I find mountain hiking refreshing. It also nicely integrates with my passion for photography. Luckily, there is an abundance of beautiful mountains to climb and photograph in my area.

### Cycling

I spent half of my childhood in a local bicycle shop and I love cycling. I can assemble and fix a bike. I cycle on my road bicycle most often but I also have an old-school mountain bike (MTB) machine.

### Running

I usually run alone or with my friend. However, I broke my routine by taking part in [Business Run 2018](https://live.sts-timing.pl/businessrun2018/person.php?n=63&d=1) as one of the **Motorola Solutions Gatekeepers** runners.

### Origami

I find paper folding both intricate and relaxing. Also, paper figurines make fantastic gifts and minimalistic home or office decor.
