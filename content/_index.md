## Professional life

I am a former teacher who joined the IT sector. I work at the intersection of content, code, and AI. My day-to-day work includes writing the docs, developing tools, and maintaining workflows. I aim at making technical writing as frictionless and maintainable as possible. In other words, I like automating the boring stuff.

On top of my technical endeavors, I like demoing solutions, consulting, and conducting workshops. Once a teacher, always a teacher.

## After hours

To unwind, I take pleasure in running, cycling, and hiking. I appreciate good stories and aesthetic works of art. Sometimes I will even take a photo or two.

I am also a keen tinkerer and hardware repair enthusiast. I like to stay up to date with the latest tech news by reading newsletters, listening to podcasts, and watching tech videos.
