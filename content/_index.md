## Professional life

I transitioned from teaching English to the IT sector, working at the intersection of content, code, and AI. My work involves writing documentation, developing tools, and maintaining workflows. I focus on making technical writing as frictionless and maintainable as possible. In other words, I like automating the boring parts.

On top of my technical endeavors, I like demoing solutions, consulting, and conducting workshops. Once a teacher, always a teacher.

## After hours

To unwind, I run, cycle, or hike. I appreciate good stories and aesthetic art, and occasionally take photos.

I am also a keen tinkerer and hardware repair enthusiast. I stay up to date with tech news by reading newsletters, listening to podcasts, and watching tech videos.
