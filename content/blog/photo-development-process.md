## Original photo

Let's have a look at the original photo. It's fairly well exposed and composed. There are no completely black or overexposed areas. However, because of the heavy clouds, it may look a little bit dark and dull.

My goal for this edit was to make the photo more lively, vibrant, and punchy. I also wanted to retain the heavy sky element. I think it compliments the mountaintops nicely and makes the composition more interesting. On top of that, I wanted to make the mountains more prominent.

## Technicalities

I captured this photo with Canon EOS 50D coupled with the Canon EF-S 17-85 mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens. There was a plenty of light, so I could use low ISO (200) and fairly high aperture (f/16) to get the most from the scene. With 1/250 exposure time, 61mm focal length, and optical stabilization, I could comfortably take this photo without a tripod.

When it's cold, camera sensors tend to generate less noise. Feel free to experiment with higher-than-usual ISO values in winter!

I saved the image in Canon's RAW format (CR2). By using RAW instead of a processed and compressed JPEG, I was able to capture the most information in the file. This came in handy later on.

I used desktop Adobe Lightroom for a long time. Recently, I switched to an iPad version of Affinity Photo 2 and I love this app! I wish Serif could add a way to copy-paste edits from one photo to another, but hey! You cannot have everything.
