## Original photo

Let's have a look at the [original photo](/media/blog/photo-development-process/original-photo.cr2). It's fairly well exposed and composed. There are no completely black or overexposed areas. However, because of the heavy clouds, it may look a little bit dark and dull.

My goal for this edit was to make the photo more lively, vibrant, and punchy. I also wanted to retain the heavy sky element. I think it compliments the mountaintops nicely and makes the composition more interesting. On top of that, I wanted to make the mountains more prominent.

I sometimes don't how I want to develop my photos. In such a case, I often just start developing and go with the flow.

## Technicalities

I captured this photo with Canon EOS 50D coupled with the Canon EF-S 17-85 mm f/4-5.6 IS USM lens. There was a plenty of light, so I could use low ISO (200) and fairly high aperture (f/16) to get the most from the scene. With 1/250 exposure time, 61mm focal length, and optical stabilization, I could comfortably take this photo without a tripod.

When it's cold, camera sensors tend to generate less noise. Feel free to experiment with higher-than-usual ISO values in winter!

I saved the image in Canon's RAW format (CR2). By using RAW instead of a processed and compressed JPEG, I was able to capture the most information in the file. This came in handy later on.

I used desktop Adobe Lightroom for a long time. Recently, I switched to an iPad version of Affinity Photo 2 and I love this app! I wish Serif could add a way to copy-paste edits from one photo to another, but hey! You cannot have everything.

## Development

I opened the CR2 file in a dedicated RAW editor built into Affinity Photo. This way, I was able to make adjustments to exposure and white balance without sacrificing the image quality and creating artifacts.

### Exposure

I started my adjustments with a slight **Exposure** and **Brightness** bump, and a small **Black point** increase to recover some contrast on the other side of histogram. I decided that I'm happy with minimal adjustments because the original photo was correctly exposed and I didn't want to overexpose bright areas or make blacks too prominent.

Then, I proceeded with decreasing **Shadows** to make them stand out more and decreasing **Highlights** to recover details from nearly blown-out areas. This maneuver made the image less punchy and contrasty but enabled me to make clouds and mountains more detailed.

To compensate for shadows and highlights decrease, I circled back to exposure adjustments and increased **Exposure** and **Brightness**. This way, I ended up with a fairly punch and contrasty image, without any major losses in details.

### Lens fixes

Now the boring part, I enabled all software fixes for artifacts created by my lens. This fixed pillow distortions, chromatic aberration, and vignetting.

Sometimes I don't remove natural lens vignetting. However, I don't feel like having a vignette in this photo.

### Curves

Adjusting **Curves** enabled me to increase contrast in a more controlled way than adjusting the global **Contrast** slider. I went with a classic S curve that made very light tones lighter and middle tones darker, without touching blacks too much.

### Enhancements

Now the fun part!
