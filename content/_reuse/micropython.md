I used these tools to create this project:

* [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE
* [MicroPico](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) extension
* [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension  
I attach Raspberry Pi[^1] Pico to Raspberry Pi[^1] 4B+ that I remote into from my development computer.

I used the most recent [MicroPython](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html#drag-and-drop-micropython) available at the development time to create the runtime logic.
