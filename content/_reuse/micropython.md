For this project, I utilized the following tools:

* [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE
* [MicroPico](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) extension
* [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension  
I connect Raspberry Pi[^1] Pico to Raspberry Pi[^1] 4B+ that I remote into from my development computer.
* [mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.18/reference/mpremote.html) CLI tool  
I use mpremote to install packages through [mip](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/packages.html).

To implement the runtime logic, I employed the most recent [MicroPython](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html#drag-and-drop-micropython) version at the time of development.
